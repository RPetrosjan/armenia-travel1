The majority of the books have precious leather covers with stamping and silver pressing. Most are full of elaborate miniatures, very important elements of medieval Armenian art. The Matenadaran building (architect Mark Grigorian) has the advantageous position of being located on hilltop of the Mashtots Avenue ending part. It dominates the center of Yerevan. This building made of basalt, reflects the forms and specifics of Armenian architecture. The Matenadaran has departments of Bibliography and Textual Studies, Old Chronicles, Medieval Chronicles, Documents and Miniatures Studies, Preservation, Restoration and Copying of Manuscripts and Archival Documents. It also has a library with a huge stock of Armenian study-related publications.

Edmidw: 'It is situated 21km west of Yerevan, in the center of Ejmiadzin city. According to the tradition during 60 years days of preaching Gregory the illumination had a dream that Jesus descended from the sky with a golden hammer and revealed to him a place where he was to construct the first Armenian Christian church instead of a pagan temple. Gregory followed Gods will and named the place Ejmiadzin. According to the testimonies of historian Agathangeghos, the cathedral was built close to the royal palace during the first years of Christianity in Armenia (301-303). Echmiatsin is Vatican of Armenia. The destination hosts two large museums. Inside the church itself there are remnants of Noah’s Ark and a separate “ethnographic” museum which hosts treasures, art, and religious relics that have important significance for Christians all over the world.'
